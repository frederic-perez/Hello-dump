This is a very simple project aiming at identifying what we call "dangerous functions" that potentially raise exceptions. In addition, in the future we can also produce dump files when crashing (to help debugging). These are called "minidumps" in the Microsoft Windows world.

We use to build binaries for these settings:

- Microsoft Windows
  - 10 Pro
    - Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 v17 (64-bit) » x64
    - Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 v16 » x64
    - ~~Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 v15 » x64~~ (discontinued)
    - ~~Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 v14 » x64~~ (discontinued)
  - 8.1
    - ~~Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 v12 » Win64~~ (discontinued)
    - ~~Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 » 32-bit~~ (discontinued)
