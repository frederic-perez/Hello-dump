This is a very simple project aiming at identifying what we call "dangerous functions" that potentially raise exceptions. In addition, in the future we can also produce dump files when crashing (to help debugging). These are called "minidumps" in the Microsoft Windows world.

We use to build binaries for these settings:

- Microsoft Windows 10 Pro: Visual Studio 14 2015 x64
- ~~Microsoft Windows 8.1: Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64~~ (discontinued)
- ~~Microsoft Windows 8.1: Visual Studio 2008 32-bit~~ (discontinued)
